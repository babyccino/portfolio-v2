DonationReceipt.Online aims to streamline the process of generating, downloading, and sending donation receipts to donors. The application application seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks Online to retrieve pertinent receipt data, as well as with Stripe for processing payments, and AWS's SES and Lambda for email communication. Additionally, it utilizes Go and WebSockets to provide real-time updates to users regarding the status of their email campaigns. The development of this application entailed close collaboration with the Intuit team to ensure precision and adherence to legal requirements and Intuit's policies.
