I spearheaded the development and implementation of a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite
from the ground up using Cypress, ensuring robust coverage across a complex codebase
that includes around 50 pages and a complex backend architecture.
This initiative played a crucial role in the rapid growth of the company
by enabling the swift and reliable development and deployment of new pages,
contributing significantly to the overall scalability and performance of the platform.
