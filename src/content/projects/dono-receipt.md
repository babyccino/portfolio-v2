This project aims to streamline the process of generating, downloading,
and sending donation receipts to donors. This app integrates with QuickBooks
Online to fetch relevant data receipts as well as with Stripe for payments
and AWS's SES for emails. Creating this app involved interfacing with the
Intuit team to ensure accuracy and compliance with legal requirements and Intuit's policies.
