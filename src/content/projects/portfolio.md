This is the second iteration of my portfolio site, created with Astro.
This site leverages the view-transitions api to create seamless, beautiful transitions between the various pages.
I created this portfolio page, using no css libraries, taking inspiration from
other portfolio sites while adding my own flair. I used css over js animations as
much as possible for performance. I have tried to make the site fully accessible
by supporting motion reduction and making sure the site is usable without a mouse.
