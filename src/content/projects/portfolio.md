This is my second iteration of a portfolio site, crafted with Astro.
Employing the view-transitions API, I've seamlessly woven beautiful transitions between pages.
The backdrop animation showcases custom three.js WebGL shaders.
My commitment to accessibility shines through, supporting motion reduction and ensuring full usability without a mouse.
